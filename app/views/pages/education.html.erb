              <h3>IESE Business School - University of Navarra</h3>
              <p>During this formative experience I put an emphasis on new technology, marketing, leadership, and data analysis. I developed a particular interest in economics, managerial accounting and complemented my classroom learnings with readings on behavioral sciences. I was astonished by the quality of the people I got to spend two years with, both my peers and our professors. This gave me the confidence and the basic principles to approach any challenge with humility and patience.</p>
