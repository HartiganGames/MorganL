            <p>In this four and a half year program, I learnt the basics of many important topics such as marketing, digital marketing, finance and project management. I came out with a great appreciation of the customer's experience rather than the intended experience of the customer and a persisting love for analytics.</p>

            <p>During this formative experience I put an emphasis on new technology, marketing, leadership, and data analysis. I developed a particular interest in economics, managerial accounting and complemented my classroom learnings with readings on behavioral sciences. I was astonished by the quality of the people I got to spend two years with, both my peers and our professors. This gave me the confidence and the basic principles to approach any challenge with humility and patience.</p>
